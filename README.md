# AQI-Index-Analysis
🌍 AQI Index Analysis Dashboard (India)

An interactive Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to analyze, visualize, and monitor air pollution levels across Indian states and cities.
This project provides clear insights into AQI trends, pollution severity, and major contributing pollutants to support data-driven environmental awareness and decision-making.

📊 Project Overview

Air pollution is a major environmental and health concern in India. This dashboard analyzes AQI data to:

Monitor air quality levels across states and cities

Identify high-risk pollution zones

Track AQI trends over time

Highlight primary pollutants affecting air quality

The dashboard is fully interactive and allows users to filter data by Year, State, Area, and Month.
